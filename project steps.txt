1.Create Database 
create the structure of all the tables required

we need these transformations to be done in the Data flow from the flat file sources to transfer the data and save it into the DB
make sure the data types from flatfiles in the connection string are compatible with data types in the DB
the IMEI must be 14 characters and the IMSI must be 9 chareacters
make sure to set up the correct data type for each column in the connection string advanced settings
if the data type is incorerrect or any error in field in the source , redirect the rows to err_source_output table

id → int (DT_i4)

IMSI len(9),IMEI len (14) → string (DT_STR)

CELL,LAC → int 

event_type len(1) → string

event_ts → date 

2.if the IMSI or Cell or LAC or EVENT_TS fields are null then redirect these rejected rows 
into err_destination_output table 

3.use the IMSI to search the IMSI refrence table to retrieve the subscriber ID, 
if there was no subscriber ID to match then subscriber_id value will be -99999

4.first , save the IMEI into the DB as it is and get the first 8 characters from the IMEI and save it in column named TAC

5.get the last 6 characters from the IMEI and save it in column named SNR,
if the IMEI is null or its size is less than 14 then the value of TAC and SNR will be both -99999

6.after moving the data, move the processed files into processed folder
